## Prediction of metadata (specifically diseases) automatically from scientific publications
In this project we automatically predict metadata using scientific publication for the purpose of increasing the quality of biomedical metadata to make data resuable. 

Input dataset: NCBI disease corpus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/)

### Prerequisites
Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch alternatively Google Colab would suffice. 

Notebooks: all the python notebooks for used in experiments.

The experiments are threefold:
* Predicting disease terms
* Predicting super classes
* Multi-label classification

textcnn: utilities for the notebooks
